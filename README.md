# SNN-driven Spatio-Temporal SpikeNet for Enhanced Motion Performance

## Introduction

This repository introduces **Spatio-Temporal SpikeNet (STSNet)**, a novel framework based on **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** for effective analysis of intricate sports movements. Unlike traditional machine learning models (e.g., **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**), STSNet is designed to overcome challenges in processing **spatio-temporal dependencies**, particularly in **fast-paced, dynamic sports environments**.

Key challenges in traditional models include:
- **Computational complexity** and **high power consumption**.
- **Inefficiencies** in handling **temporal information** in motion sequences.

STSNet offers a more **efficient**, **biologically inspired** solution by integrating:
- **3D convolutional layers** to capture spatio-temporal features.
- A **temporal attention mechanism** to focus on key moments in a sequence.
- **Dynamic threshold adjustments** in the SNN architecture to adapt to varying motion speeds.
- **Contextual modulation** to refine predictions based on surrounding environmental context.

Extensive testing on large-scale sports datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to provide superior motion performance analysis, making it ideal for **real-time applications** in sports analytics.

## Key Features

- **Biologically Inspired SNN Architecture**: Combines the power of **spiking neural networks** with advanced **spatio-temporal features**.
- **3D Convolutional Layers**: Effectively extracts both spatial and temporal information from motion sequences.
- **Temporal Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on critical moments in motion sequences, improving accuracy.
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustments**: Adapts to different speeds in sports movements for more precise predictions.
- **Contextual Modulation**: Incorporates environmental factors to improve understanding of complex movements.
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Outperforms traditional models in accuracy, precision, and computational efficiency.
